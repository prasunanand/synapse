# Synapse

A Deep Learning library.

Synapse is currently a hobby project. Its not ready for production. I am building this project to test RbCUDA.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prasunanand/synapse
cd synapse
rake compile
rake test

```

```ruby
gem 'synapse'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install synapse

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
